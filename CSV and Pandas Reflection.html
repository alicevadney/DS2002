1. What did you learn about working with CSV files and pandas DataFrames in
this assignment?

I knew beforehand how to load csv files into Python using pandas, but I learned how to
create graphs using pandas and find the correlation coefficient of two or more columns in a dataset.
Additionally, I learned how to perform data cleaning and basic analysis using pandas. These skills are
useful because pandas is a commonly used package, and I am hoping to have a career in statistics and data
analysis, where these skills will be especially important. Knowing how to work with datasets is a crucial
part to data analytics.

2. What was the most challenging aspect of this assignment, and how did you
overcome it?

The most challenging aspect of the assignment was figuring out why certain code didn't work, especially
when the same code chunk worked on other columns of the dataset. I overcame this challenge by tweaking
the code or, if that didn't work, researching alternative code to solve the question.

All datasets come with their own unique challenges, so being able to work through the challenges of the
ACC basketball statistics helps me in working with roadblocks in other datasets by giving me the tools
and experience to confront a problem successfully. Knowing how one problem was solved can lead to the
solution to another. Additionally, the statistics in this dataset are often the ones that teams, no matter
the industry, are interested in, such as top performers, averages, and totals. Even though we
analyzed specifically sports data, all companies are interested in their own industry-relevant data and
trends.

The skills performed in this assignment are the foundation for all data analyses, whether simple projects
or more advanced tasks, like machine learning and modeling. Knowing the basics prepares me for future jobs,
in which I will be implementing my knowledge of data cleaning and analysis to bigger and more complex projects.
